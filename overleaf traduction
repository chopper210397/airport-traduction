\section{David Whiteley - Interviewer}

Good morning good afternoon and good
evening everyone
thank you for joining this the second in
aci world webinar series exploring the
economic impact of
covid  19 on the airport sector and the past
recovery
my name is david whiteley i am aci
world's vice president of marketing and
communications
and i'm joined today by our director
general luis felipe de oliveira
and vice president for economics patrick
lucas today's webinar will examine the
continuing economic impact of the
pandemic and look at prospects for a
global recovery of the airport sector
key findings and policy considerations
will also be presented from aci's new
publications
the long-term carbon goal study which
set a net zero carbon target for the
world's airports and
the global outlook of airport capital
expenditure meeting sustainable
development goals and future air travel
demand
these studies are well-timed and
precedent
as the industry navigates the continuing
crisis investment and airport
infrastructure will be needed more than
ever to accelerate recovery and
stimulate economies
these investments must also strike a
balance between a growing air transport
sector with commitments to decarbonize
the industry in support of the united
nations sustainable development goals
and other international targets felipe
and patrick will present aci world's
latest findings
and will then open the floor for
questions if you would like to put a
question to the panel please send it to
us for the chat function
and we'll address as many of them as we
can so without further ado
felipe please lead us off
\section{Luis Felipe de Oliveira}
hello uh good morning good day afternoon
good evening
depends where you are and hello everyone
and thank you for joining us
for our second covid 19 economic impact
analysis
and the path to recovery webinar
as the data and analysis will reveal
today shows
that we continue to make a positive
incremental steps
towards rebuilding the global
connectivity
and returning the aviation to the
pathway of growth
that we collectively established before
the covid19 pandemic
this is crucial for a global economy in
the communities we serve
as the air transport industry is
responsible for
around nine percent of the global gdp
with the catalytic effect that
airlines airports and other players of
the industry produce
i'm currently in europe traveling
between athens
rome and geneva for some business
meetings as well as enjoying some
quality time with my family
months of visualization have forced us
to be creative
in how we maintain our social and
business connections
we are able to shift to online meetings
thanks to zoom and teams, however is no
denying the value and effectiveness of
the face-to-face meetings
i must admit it is really nice to
finally be back on the road again
and be able to reconnect with friends
and colleagues
over a delicious meal or enjoy a nice
glass of wine with the real
toast we are definitely reaching a
tightening point
in the Covid 19 pandemic a crosswords
that were optimized of for a sustained
recovery has met the resistance of the
governments
to take a risk-based but proactive
approach
to easing travel restrictions and
lockdowns
despite these increasing positive signs
Covid 19 remains an existential crisis
for airports,
airlines and their commercial partners
and aviation still needs support
in the reasonable policy decisions from
the governments
if an even sustained recovery is to be
realized
 the lack of coordination
among governments remain one of our
biggest concerns
it has been difficult to sustain an
industry restart
with this uncoordinated approach which
in turn
has the will to continue the effect
affected
affect the passengers confidence
passengers
will only be willing to travel if the
rules are
clear and harmonized across different
countries
just as important as this coordination
from governments
are our partnerships within aviation
our industry has always been an
interconnected and interdependent
ecosystem
and recovery will require weighted
levels of collaboration
and partnership among industry
stakeholders
it is clear to me that during this
crisis the collaborative approach among
all participation
participants in the aviation ecosystem
has increased
airports have supported the industry
with waivers in parking fees
increasing the credit terms for airlines
and supported the airline community with
various measures
in addition airports despite of the lack
of movements
maintain operations to receive
repatriation flights
cargo flights with goods medicines
and medical equipment to help to cope
with the pandemic
and most recently supporting the
transport of the vaccines
most airports in the world are providing
incentives to airlines
for the come back to the operations as
without passengers
airports will not return to a financial
health
there is no one-size-fits-all
approach that will satisfy all the
players in the affiliation
but we remain ready and willing to work
with airlines
and navigation providers and  our
partners
on solutions that benefit us all and
most importantly the passengers as we
work together
we must also ensure that we do not lose
sign for the bigger picture
the long-term goal of the achievement
next zero carbon emissions
no later than 2050 new
and improved airport infrastructure will
be a key
to continue development of the airplane
air transport beyond the recovery
from the Covid 19 pandemic sustainable
long-term growth for the industry which
need increased
airport capital investment reasonable
policies for the use of these lots
and developments improving the economic
social and environmental footprint of
airports aci has recently published two
studies
1.the global outlook of airport capital
expenditure
meeting sustainable development goals in
the future air travel demand
and 2.the aci long-term carbon goal for
the world's
airports. these studies explore
how the airport industry current
financial shortfall poses significant
challenges to the modernize the
infrastructure
and the long-term target and the net
zero operations
by 2050. we will need governments
to work with the airports in supporting
and incentivizing recovery
and to mitigate the risk of failing
short
in the sustainable long-term growth for
the industry
this is the huge challenge but i believe
aci role
is a key influencer and driver of the
change
in our industry we know that global
collaboration between us
and other representatives of the
aviation ecosystem
especially Ikea and Ayata
and the other value global partners will
be essential
for an industry to successfully sustain
a balanced recovery
and beyond we want to work with our
partners
to support industry and this will be a
key
element for our success we are stronger
together
and airlines and airports have a play
that have to play a key cooperative role
in recovery and the long-term
development of the industry
i hope we enjoyed this webinar and thank
you very much
for joining us.

\section{David Whiteley}
thank you for sending saint philippe and
really showing the
short-term the medium-term and the
long-term challenges for the industry
but it's also good to
hear of your travels and um that we are
seeing more and more signs for optimism
so thank you now acer world's director
of economics patrick lucas will take us
through the detail
uh of the economic impact analysis and
uh look ahead to the pathway for
recovery
\section{Patrick Lucas}
good day everyone thank you david it's
it's great
uh to engage with all of you and present
on some of the latest
industry data and insights i'd like to
give you
a short roadmap of the presentation
the presentation is intended to also
spark discussion and debate
among airport members and of course the
broader ecosystem of all stakeholders
linked to air transport
i will cover the 1. immediate impacts of
the pandemic
in in 2020 in 2021  i will
then 2. analyze the pathways to industry
recovery
highlighting both the the upside
potential but as well as some of the
downside risks
i will also 3.  take a longer term view
beyond the near term to address
both the industry challenges but also
the opportunities related to
infrastructure development
sustainability and and environmental
goals finally i'd like to 4. conclude with
the selection of
managerial and policy levers that could
very much
help speed up the recovery towards a
better equilibrium.
now it's been more than 15 months since
the world health organization declared
the coven 19 outbreak a global pandemic
since then daily life across the globe
has changed along
along with this human tragedy the crisis
has also resulted in a dramatic impact
to the global economy trade and mobility
practically all aspects
of economic and social activity were
were and still are disrupted, now the
latest covid 19 variant the "the delta"
variant is is the most contagious yet up
to 60 percent more
transmissible than other variants and
and it poses uh challenges
of course to to a swift recovery in
certain markets, however and this is
something that needs to be stressed
current vaccines are effective against
it for those segments of the population
who have full dosage of protection and
this is important in the context of
travel restrictions and and government
policy going forward
now if we take a a retrospective look
at airport traffic the previous
downturns over the last decades pale in
comparison
uh to the impact of the pandemic they
they appear as slight cracks
in the road whereas the current crisis
resembles a cliff of un
unpresented unprecedented proportions
now
unfortunately the passenger traffic
decline in 2020
brought us back to traffic levels from
over two decades ago before 1997.
now fortunately aviation is resilient as
felipe said we we are in the business of
connecting
people uh businesses and and culture
and this will prevail while we will get
back to 2019 levels in a couple of years
it could take as much as 20 years or
more to get back to the original trend
that was forecasted before
the pandemic so that is the the green
line you see there
now i'd like to drill down and magnify
the extent of the impact in 2020
and 2021 on on a quarterly basis and
looking at the path to recovery in the
second half
of this year
now the crisis has removed almost 6
billion passengers by the end of 2020
compared to the projected baseline
so the projected baseline is basically
the pre-covid 19
forecast for 2020 and this represents a
decline of 62 percent of of global
passenger traffic in terms of lost
revenues
this represents a decline of 129
billion usd(dollars) in in 2020. so the typical
airport hub on average earns it about
earns about 1.3 billion on average
so we're looking at something like the
100 busiest hubs in the world having
their revenues completely wiped out
.So the lasting uh adverse impact of
of coven 19 is is forecasted to remove
an additional
5 billion passengers by the end of of
2021.
so here it will represent  a 51
decline in in 2021 as compared to the
the baseline
now there is this down side risk which
is represented a bit by the
the shaded red area under the dotted red
line
uh the world health organization and
many country leaders are raising
concerns over a two-track pandemic
uh favoring wealthier nations as
vaccinations in poorer countries lag
so the group of 20  finance ministers
have stated in a recent communique and i
quote that
new variants of the coronavirus and an
uneven pace of vaccinations
could undermine a brightening outlook
for for the world economy
now in other words a vaccine divide
could never
inevitably lead to a an air travel
divide
which  in turn threatens the
benefits of aviation and some key
emerging markets
in the near term
.Now revenues are very much tightly
correlated to traffic
on on both the aeronautical and the
non-aeronautical revenue
streams now the challenge or the tragedy
of our business is that airports remain
a capital intensive business like other
infrastructure intensive 
businesses
this means that there are high fixed
costs with relatively highly leveraged
debt levels
so at least 35 percent of costs are
fixed and many other costs are
are semi-fixed even with low traffic
levels there are certain
services and utilities that need to be
put in place to guarantee the safety of
passengers but also to maintain
 cargo operations now while creditors
have been very accommodating given that
travel restrictions are imposed
basically basically exogenously
there is this new risk paradigm and
impact
that this is having on  airport
financing costs or the cost of capital
and this in turn has implications on the
the future airport cost base
now that's the bad news what about you
know some of the some of the good news
well i think it's important to emphasize
that intrinsic demand
based on underlying fundamentals of
income
and and price are not depressed
governments have been quite quick
to respond in 2020 with fiscal stimulus
along with  wage support schemes in
in many major markets people have money
in their pockets
there is confidence in vaccines uh
coupled with  this
notion of vacation deprivation so i mean
this is a formula for a potential boom
people need to get connect again and
experience the world around them
ultimately again and we stress this, you
know we are in the business of
connecting people
now on this chart we have the the OECD
countries and and consumer confidence
index
uh so the OECD countries basically
encompass 
almost 40 countries many of which are
the the highest income countries in the
world
so we could see the strengthened
consumer outlook
we are back to the uh you know the 2019
levels in terms of
um consumer sentiment and confidence
and this obviously has an important
impact on air transport and the
propensity to travel
now international restrictions are
leading to a
dichotomy in terms of market segments
international travel
remains suppressed with declines of 84
percent 
in the spring months of this year as
compared to 2019
so in these charts  you could see the
latest 2021 data
and if you look at the blue line, so the
blue line is basically the 2021 data
and it is compared to 2020 and 2019,
so 2019 is the gray
line and 2020 is is the red line
,now on the other hand you do have the
domestic markets
continue to show a strong bounce back ,
domestic markets 
are down 34 percent comparatively speaking
now in some markets we do see this form
of
like i was saying earlier this vaccine
optimism
and and this vacation deprivation in
many spheres
there is this pent-up demand and there
is this appetite for travel
now if we look in the on the right-hand
side of your scheme of your screen it's
important to note that some of the very
sizable domestic markets have 
reached full recovery
such as china and russia in terms of
domestic traffic
okay we also see this huge domestic
markets like the U.S
also accelerating on the domestic front
week after week
approaching 2019 levels and this is
independent of the the country's
international traffic.
 many of our forecasts  over the
short term
which in turn then feed into the medium
term so meaning over the next five years
 really hinge on the effectiveness
of vaccines
it also considers the supply chain to
deploy the vaccinations to a significant
proportion of the population
to develop herd immunity as well as the
containment of
barium virus viruses now we will see the
biggest uptick
as a result of pent up demand and of
course vaccine rollout
in h2 so the second half of 2021.
by the end of 2021 we are expecting to
be in the the 45 to 55 percent  
range of 2019 levels so basically
between the
the red and yellow lines and the red the
the red line is basically the baseline
scenario
the yellow line is the low scenario or
called the more pessimistic scenario
again there is this penta the demand
there is this accumulated savings
and and people would travel if they
could so there is a strong possibility
we get back even above the red line
after 2021
after restrictions are lifted or certain
travel corridors are established on some
key international markets and segments
the lower or more pessimistic scenario
assumes a slower recovery due to these
variants and a slower vaccine rollout
now if we look at the baseline scenario
the red line which assumes that a good
proportion of the vaccines will be
rolled out in
in 2021 in major markets traffic
is expected to get back to 2019 levels
by the end of 2023
international markets of course because
of the restrictions
 and this you could see on the bottom
 left-hand chart well we
expect traffic levels to get back
by 2024 based on the baseline .of course
there are certain markets
like europe which is heavily dependent
on international traffic
and transfer passengers this may take
even longer
.now looking beyond the short and medium
term so looking beyond
the crisis i think  it's very
important to remind us all that
the long-term fundamentals of our
industry still apply
 because we will get back to
2019 levels and and i like to highlight
uh the fact that this is a world with
capacity constraints, airport capacity
constraints
,so we need to be uh cognizant of the
demography of aviation
many markets have seen aviation open up
over the last decades
and we've also seen the propensity to
travel rise quickly with rises in income
interestingly eighty percent of the
world's population resides
 in emerging markets and developing
economies
.so we look at these four markets alone
okay with huge domestic markets
and even uh latin demand okay
so china india, indonesia, vietnam this
represents about 40
of the world's population so our longer
term forecasts are very much
based on these underlying fundamentals
of future
the future cost of travel but also the
demography of aviation with its
interrelationship with income levels
 which have the greatest 
weighting overall .now many countries
have just peaked or will peak in the
years to come in terms of working age
population
and what is that well that's basically
the population age between
15 and 65. so a larger
working age population translates into a
higher propensity to travel
and here we have on your right hand side
we have two examples brazil
which has literally just peaked in 2020
and you have india a huge market which
is set to peak in the years to come
in in 2040. so you may ask well what
about
the mature markets of europe and north
america well they will benefit as well
there will also be these important
feedback loops as a result of
international traffic growth
originating from these uh from these
emerging markets
now as i mentioned earlier the desire to
travel based on affordability is is
present now
in places like the u.s which are
approaching uh pre-covid levels
 even though we are still amidst uh in
a pandemic. now what are
some of the implications here with
respect to infrastructure
or the capex (the capital expenditure)
required
to meet this longer term demand and as
david mentioned
we have just recently released a study
called the global outlook for airport
capital expenditure
with the support of Hamad international
airport and we've done this in
collaboration with oxford economics
now while there has been this estimated
decline of 33 percent
in in capital spending as a result of
the pandemic
or capex deferment , capex is
expected to bounce back
uh and and you know by 2022 but we are
we're not where we should be uh this is
partly due to the
 longer time horizons of these
investments that go well beyond the
crisis
now overall the the global 
net decline in capex was less
pronounced uh than then the decline say
in traffic or
or revenues 
 but uh you it is very heterogeneous
from one region to the next
some markets like the U.S uh thanks to
the cares act
and they push for some of this pump
priming into infrastructure
did not experience a decline per se
certain asian markets remained
relatively stable too
however you had  
european markets that have suffered some
of the biggest setbacks
having to reduce capital spending due to
major financial shortfalls now between
2021 and 2040 projections indicate
approximately 2.4 trillion in airport
total capital investments will be needed
so these are the capital needs
to close the long-term infrastructure
gap to meet demand.
so i mean and this is comparable to to
the gdp of some
G7 countries right so countries like
like italy for instance
.now of this amount asia pacific
comprises about 54
of the needed capital investments this
reflects the
the region's rapid passenger growth
historically
and in the years to come and 
subsequent demand to develop new
greenfield airports
as well as to modernize and expand
existing airport infrastructure
now even with the crisis and the
expected recovery to 2019 levels in
several years
traffic is still expected to double by
2040 if we think of this in terms of
unconstrained demand or potential demand
,however failure to close the the
infrastructure gap
does have some real uh socio-economic
consequences
which are very much linked to the
sustainable development goals
now based on this relationship between
passenger travel and socio-economic
outcomes
for every 1 million foregone passengers
,okay due to airport capacity constraints
in 2040
,the global air air transport industry
would support 10
500 fewer jobs and 346 million
less in gdp and that's in U.S dollars
so this is for every millionth passenger
.okay just to be clear
now following the crisis investments in
infrastructure will be needed more than
ever
to to accelerate the recovery
governments have a key role to play here
to support this recovery
and  to mitigate the risks of falling
short on certain
SDGS linked to airports in aviation and
here
you can see on your screen we have four
of them here where
airports have very long very important
linkages
to these SDGS related to economic growth
infrastructure development climate
action and and partnerships for the
goals
so related to public private
partnerships
.now let's move to  climate action
 climate change is is a global
challenge
requiring an urgent global response
given the intergovernmental panel on
climate changes
so this is the IPCC a recent call to
reach
net zero carbon emissions by by 2050.
aci long-term carbon goal  which
was recently released
after an exhaustive consultation process
with the industry and
 experts relates to the carbon
emissions under the direct control of
of airport operators and will be a
crucial component of the aviation
industry's contribution towards this
global effort
aci has created this ambitious long-term
carbon goal to drive further action
and support the decarbonization of
airports
as they respond to climate change for
for net zero carbon emissions by 2050,
recognizing that each jurisdiction is
different so and each airport is
different
meaning that the speed in reaching net
zero will vary
considerably from  one region to the
other
now besides airport size and activity
level
, geographic location is the next
greatest
determinant of airport emissions at a
macro level and i just mentioned that in
in the previous slide, climate conditions
play a key role
impacting the extent of heating and
cooling required
year-round, and available sources of
electricity
uh have a direct impact on  scope 2
emissions and here which refers to kind
of
purchased energy sources ,national and
regional differences 
are clearly visible when we look at the
kind of the historical data
and these different differences will
continue in the future
as different regions see different
trends and speeds
of  grid decarbonization in coming
decades
.now although individual airports can and
do implement
solutions that deviate from 
national averages
the main determinant at the global level
is
expected to be the evolution of general

electricity decarbonization okay this is
kind of 
a key ingredient here, other regional
differences relate to
to the policy or the regulatory context
right so the interdependencies with
other sectors
or national priorities and as well as
the available and relative
cost of emerging new technologies , so
all of these have been
considered for each main emission
reduction measure
.now let's move to airport investments
. you know  the economics of
reducing the
the carbon footprint um there are almost
340 airports
in the aci carbon accreditation program
and over 60 airports that have achieved
carbon neutral
neutrality historically speaking uh
airports that have achieved carbon
neutrality status
invested on average about 12 percent more in
capital
and take an average of 6.1 years to go
from
no accreditation to to carbon neutral
.now we need to distinguish between
carbon neutrality and
net zero emissions beyond the suite of
emission reduction measures
carbon offset credits are used to reach
carbon neutrality
whereas net zero makes use of of carbon
removals
or net emission technologies which will
 be more present in the 
future
thus the capex investment for net zero
is
more significant. now to
reduce
uh energy use in new and existing
airport
buildings airport operators have an
access to an array of
efficiency measures these measures could
result in this additional
cost premiums depending on the measures
taken
now drawing on previous studies  net
zero capex premium
costs could be inferred for both
greenfield
and brownfield airport terminals so if
you look in on
the bottom half of your screen there for
a brownfield airport terminal retrofit
we are looking at a net zero capex
premium
between 14 and 19 percent above and beyond what
is called the the lead or glow
gold uh platinum renovation
for  greenfield airports and this is
on the the right hand side
you could see that and this is starting
a terminal
from scratch constructing a terminal
from scratch you would have a net zero
capex premium of eight percent
as compared to some building standards
 in advanced
economies
now i'd like to kind of caveat this
capex premium for net zero
 as mentioned earlier depending on the
circumstance and also
of course the level of government policy
stringency of achieving that zero
more quickly wide scale retrofits or
major capital investments
may not be systematically required
i mean other than asset replacement and
this very much has to do with the
the hierarchy of emission reduction
measures
which you see on the center of your
screen here the electrical grid plays a
central role here
in fact purchase electricity generated
off-site is the single biggest
contributor to
to airport emissions so the level of
electrical grid decarbonization is a
fundamental ingredient
 on the pathway to net zero i mean you
do have
other areas listed here related to
efficiency measures so like
lighting at an airport  or hvac
heating and cooling or the use of smart
controls or
artificial intelligence airports also
have a huge fleet of vehicles so moving
towards
low or zero emission vehicles or  evs
uh will be uh additional fundamental
steps
.now airports that have achieved net zero
or on the path to achieving net zero
soon  and we have three of them listed
here
on the right side so dallas fort worth

christ church and and sudabe airports
and there are many more um typically
have access to renewable energy sources
or have access to a highly decarbonized
electrical grid
that's because the electricity is
generated off-site outside of the hands
of airports
collaborating  with governments and
other stakeholders will be
vital in great transitioning as opposed
to forcing airports to to retrofit their
buildings
in the near term.

\subsection{Policy and managerial levers stimulate demand and supply} 
So let's now move to to the concluding
section
and looking at some of the policy and
managerial levers that could help propel
a recovery
okay and and we
we've distinguished distinguish this
between we call it demand side and
supply side levers
now to start what are some of the
factors that could help stimulate demand
okay now 
 and let's start off with some of the
managerial levers like
stuff that is happening at the airport
level and consumer demand
very much goes hand in hand with
consumer confidence
so what are some of these managerial
levers that airports have 
implemented and considered
now without a question the current
crisis has sped up
airport innovations and investments
to win back the passenger
so this means digitizing aspects of the
journey having this touch free
and contactless journey is part and
parcel of helping passengers regain
confidence in
in a worry-free manner so as this joint
initiative
of aci and ayata next or call it new
experience travel technologies
has created this shared vision for the
future of travel
and this existed uh even before the
pandemic but it has now
even been sped up so here we're talking
about you know
advancement of  airport activities
improving the customer experience and
efficiency with advanced processing
the use of biometric technologies
again increasing these touchless
interactions between passengers and
airlines airports and other stakeholders
with access to kind of this trusted
real-time data
remain these these emerging concepts of
next,
similarly  the aci airport health
accreditation program
is a very important innovation that acts
to reassure the traveling public
,now based on a network of more than 600
airports of all sizes
have prioritized health and safety 
as their path to the recovery, the AHA
program provides airports with an
assessment of how aligned their their
health measures are
with international  standards and
alignment with
with IKO so the international civil
aviation organization's recommendations
so just some  key managerial levers
that have
helped with respect to  boosting 
consumer confidence
.now there are also the fundamental
drivers
of air transport demand at least in the
conventional
sense right like any good or service 
air transport demand is a function of 
income and prices right, so let's start
off with income
so the chart on the left side shows a
contraction in income levels wherever
you see red
for  2020 right so that the recession
of 2020. now the IMF sees a bounce back
in 2021
but with some you know divergent
recoveries but 
aggregate demand remains strong and and
this is thanks to
to government fiscal and monetary
stimuluses
as well as these wage support schemes um
that said i mean the presence of some of
the virus variants
remains a downside risk for for the
global economy
.now the chart on the right shows
 oil and jet fuel prices
 while there has been a recent rally
 jet fuel prices remains relatively
low
at least from a historical perspective i
mean if we go back before
uh before 2015 and before 2014
my while lower input prices definitely
helps with  lower airfares across
the board
with an expectation that fares may stay
low
for  a while um there are some
important policy
levers that governments need to consider
in stimulating demand from a price
perspective
and here i'm talking about  
taxes okay and and we'll come to this on
on the the next slide
.now many jurisdictions 
are heavily taxed and have been heavily
taxed historically
the COVID 19 crisis has made clear that
this
cascading effects of the loss of direct
aviation
economic activity, moreover 
there is also an indirect induced and
catalytic impact that is felt
from from the crisis so  from the the
ground handling worker
at an airport to a waiter or waitress in
a restaurant
or service agent for  a hotel i mean
you have that entire
ecosystem that is  affected, now
regarding taxation and here i'm
referring to taxes on international
tickets and and airfares that go
directly
to the government treasury and that are
not used for aviation purposes
,now the socio-economic impacts that
would result from the removal of the tax
burden
are shown in this slide based on the
modeling of historical demand
elasticities that
that we know across the globe and across
countries
the tax burden is estimated at at 90
billion usd
globally and this was just before the
pandemic there is this clear
imbalance notably between tax revenues
received and  so the 90 billion and
the potential but suppressed
global gdp that that that could be
generated
so let me explain  the kind of the
economics or the mechanics behind this
, so
more specifically if we were to remove
taxes globally
you would get an 11 increase in traffic
on the aggregate  with even
some country markets posting even more
gains
now globally if we factor in the impact
on jobs
a removal of taxes of the 90 billion
this could
create 5.2 million jobs and generate 183
billion in gdp you end up with this
multiplier effect
you see uh and this factors in the
direct
indirect and catalytic impacts  of a
tax reduction
so very important  key point to
stimulate the  recovery here
.now let's move to the supply side i mean
what could stimulate
the supply of aviation or more
specifically airport infrastructure over
the longer term
in tandem with sustainable development
goals
,now in the short term we know that the
mobility and the supply of
international travel around the globe
has been significantly curtailed as a
result of the myriad 
of restrictions aimed at curbing uthe
spread of coVID 19
and its variants now on this slide we
have
uh travel restrictions  from kayak
ayada also produces a useful travel
regulations map
but the kayak one has has more detail so
anywhere you see the
you know the pink which is a a big
proportion of the map
you have some type of restriction
partially open
includes those countries that have
quarantines but
of course if we look at this from a
leisure travel point of view i mean
these
could also be considered closed so we
are talking about
200 countries or so with some form of
restriction
now unfortunately travel restrictions
remain largely uncoordinated
and very unpredictable although you do
have
some uh travel bubbles emerged or
that have emerged or or reinforced uh
i mean the  restrictions are wide
scale
latin american in the caribbean is one
of the regions that is probably the
least stringent  or the least amount
of  closures as you could see from the
uh the green and and or or yellow 
portions there. now generally we've
maintained that government action to
promote safe travel with
a coordinated and risk-based approach uh
to testing
and vaccinations is crucial instead of
these full-scale
restrictions  and blanket
quarantine measures
.now how do we now moving on so let's
kind of call it the supply
of aviation over the short term that you
where you have these restrictions or
restrictions on supply
.now how do we incentivize and finance
infrastructure over the longer term
now the airport industry has drastically
changed in terms of
the competitive landscape airline
.the airline industry has has
consolidated and
in fact will can continue to consolidate
 whereas airports face increased
competitive pressure
you know throwing into question whether
there is this need for
economic regulation of airports based on
on a false
assumption of you know concentrated
uh market power many jurisdictions
could actually learn  from the
australians okay
,the australian case represents a very
powerful illustration that
uh the removal of intrusive economic
regulation
and removal of airport charges price
controls
goes and pars it goes in par with with
strong traffic growth
airport capacity development and and
overall increases in customer
satisfaction
and australian government agencies
continue to recognize this and this is
done through independent reviews
,okay so that's one thing on on
economic regulation okay towards more
market-based
solutions ,since airports also serve as
as economic engines that have a
multiplier effect as we saw, governments
need to kind of also create fertile
grounds for investment and
to attract private capital whenever
necessary ,now hci does not in any way
prescribe
any specific type of ownership model in
short
airports should be permitted to operate
under a range of ownership 
models however in an economic climate
where states have taken on huge debts
and and fiscal spending because of the
pandemic i mean government financing and
full ownership of
airports may not always be a viable and
sustainable option
now what any investor looks for  is a
return of course on their investment
but because infrastructure has a
long-time horizon
it is very important that governments
ensure that
uh and the longer time horizon means
more risk right it is very important
that governments ensure
a clear and consistent legal framework
exists prior to privatizations
for instance if there is a formula you
know for
and if airports are regulated and there
is this formula for the determination of
charges
or the cost of capital and the
concession it should not suddenly be
changed by a regulator to cater to
short-sighted
uh needs of  other stakeholders
entire business models and decisions are
predicated on the rules of the game from
from the outset so regulatory risk is a
very important factor
for investors and  financing
and governments should consider this
.now if we think of a context where say
financing is linked to
certain targets or  if there are
stringent policies to meet net zero
emissions here and here we're talking
about more that the climate action
 there are several scenarios that
could be considered
now generally beyond regular asset
replacement
under a highly decarbonized grid as i
was mentioning earlier
you would have a lower  propensity
or need to retrofit from a capex
perspective
while of course incremental capital
expenditure is still required
like replacing electronic vehicle fleets
and other assets incrementally over time
in a highly decarbonized grid it is
comparably cheaper
from a capex point of view as compared
to airports
 that are on the low end
of the spectrum with fossil fuel
dependency
so a higher decarbonized electrical grid
implies a lower
capex premium or investment and vice
versa so you have this this inverse
relationship
.now when we think of government policy
for airport carbon decarbonization because of the offsite
grid  or
purchased electricity
is usually a big piece of this puzzle in
terms of airport emissions
governments along with other providers
of energy will need to to partner with
airports
and here partner partnering means you
know incentivizing
and supporting  the grid transitioning
this also means
uh access to financing tools to develop
renewable energy
or  adoption of evs and then
further down the road negative emission
technologies
again economic incentives could be in
the forms of tax credits
funding or grants
now this just to recap  and and we saw
1. the  scale of the pandemic's impact
on passenger traffic in 2021
in in 2020 and 2021 2.we examined the
pathways to recovery looking at both the
upside and the pent-up demand
but also the downside risk that has
developed as a result of the
transmission of variants
3. we looked at the demand side
managerial and policy levers related to
building up
consumer confidence from an airport's
perspective
4.we consider the income and price factors
that stimulate
demand and how taxes or the removal
thereof
can help boost a recovery in
international traffic
and extend even wider benefits to 
 those jurisdictions  in terms of
socioeconomic outcomes 5. finally we saw
the policy tools that could be used to
incentivize infrastructure development
given that airports are economic engines
with strong links to
to the SDG´s the sustainable development
goals
we looked at public private partnerships
we looked at light-handed approaches to
regulation
and and all of these and and and then
finally we looked at
 you know this road ahead in terms of
what it means for for airport to
carbonization
 going up to 2050.
so thank you all for taking the time 
and thank you for this
this great opportunity to engage with
you ,i'm very much happy to  answer any
questions or  comments you have
um and and i pass it back to you david
thank you
\section{David and Public questions}
thanks patrick and thanks for that thor
examination not just the short term
challenges
 as a result of cover guaranteeing
and the path to recovery but also the
longer term
objectives of net zero and increased
capital investments so a really good
entire examination of not just where we
are now but where we need to go
so as patrick said we're now open for
questions
um please send them through the chat
function of the webinar and we'll put
as many of them as possible to patrick
and felipe
, we have a couple through already so...
\subsection{Question from public}
the first question of opposed to felipe
uh and it draws on um what you're saying
at the start around
around travel and optimism at the moment
but since the last update have you
become more or less optimistic for a
full recovery of the airport industry
and is
is there more that governments can be
doing to support airports
 \subsection{Felipe´s response}
 thank you david then and thank
you patrick for the  very good
presentation and as as you all know i'm
a very optimist
by myself and i'm more optimistic from
the last webinar because i believe there
is a good developments
 in the world in terms of  the
vaccines
we are reaching 3.5 billion vaccines
around the world and that will allow
people to to travel , unfortunately a
long road
of recovery  we are seeing
developments we are seeing things going
better than you than gone before
but we still far away  from what you
want to be
in terms of the industry in terms of the
bringing the social economic
developments that you believe that you
can
provide to  our communities that we
serve, the quarantines and the restrictions
in the countries
and the  lack of the  approach and
the risk assessment
is something  that the government
must do better
and as i mentioned before i'm traveling
now through europe
and is still very confused for a
frequent traveler
that i consider myself one of them and
you can imagine for the normal people
that flies once or twice a year
and expand maybe one year or more
without traveling since now
and we see the lines at the airports
going
 long lines  consider that the
checks
 in the confusion that the each
location or which connection that the
passengers need to take
 is considering the process of the
checking
and of course in the process of the
connections as well that's why the
harmonization of the process is
something that is very important
and the government must work very hard
to have this urbanization
and he started to reopen the borders in
a more
seamless process allowing passengers
to go to point a to b without many
restrictions
without of course  the fact
that the 
tests uh maybe for passengers that are
already
vaccinated and we need a global
coordination and
of course i can't play a key role on
that uh the states play a key role on
that and follow international
regulations of course always taking care
about the populations that the
aviation industry serve
however with the right approach on the
risk assessment
will be able to mitigate the risks and
continue to travel and continue to move
this important industry
that is the aviation industry
\subsection{David interview}
on that point of um coordination but
also
drawing on some of what patrick is
talking around
around economic regulation , what other
prospects for
economic regulation of exports in the
airport airline relationship
um what's the position on charges we
hear a lot about charges
in the media at the moment so i'll maybe
i'll close that there first and then
patrick you can add your thoughts
\subsection{Patrick response}
 yeah charges is  always a
hot topic but uh we need to consider
that the charges
uh represent uh according with the
airlines around only
four percent of their total costs and
that including the charges
on their navigation service providers as
well that's right basically
is a small amount and they always in
most of the countries the charges are
regulated you know and when you have an
increase in the traffic
basically charges  growth goes down
and we see that trend  here over here
and now in the difficult times let's say
when the the traffic goes down usually
the charges needs to go
up of course the airports are working
very hard
to not have a huge increase because you
believe that you damage the traffic
however it is the role of the market and even
if we consider that you cannot have the
increases as we need
to cover our costs uh we need to have
certain
parts of the world especially to cope
with
the huge adapt and huge investments that
the industry needs to do
to continue the growth of the industry
and also to cope
with the  carbon
uh goals that we all set because that
will be the right for us to travel
,is important to mention that 
governments
had a huge amount of support
for especially for airlines and we
like that because basically the airlines
our main customers
in many relationship that we have are
very important
and we believe that is the right thing
to do continue this approach
however the governments forgot a lot
the other partners of the industry the
industries are not only
the airlines are airports our ground
handlers are other suppliers
that participate in the whole aviation
ecosystem
,60 percent of the jobs of the whole
industry are inside of the airports in
different
areas in different companies and we
believe that the governors need to see
this part of the industry as well the so
in terms of how they can support
the continuity of the process the
continuum of 
the  recovery process for this part
of  the industry as well that's why yes
we believe that
the writing support the airlines is not
saying that is not the right thing
however we need to have the support for
the other parts of the industry
including the airports as well
because we have a certain airport
especially the median small ones
 that in the border of the bankruptcy
and they play a key role
an essential role in the connectivity of
the countries supporting the communities
supporting the tourists
and supporting to other industries as well
in different parts of the globe
\subsection{Patrick interview}
yeah then maybe just to chime in there
and
thanks for the pace of really good
points there 
 i mean even if we look before the
pandemic
okay there's been a general over
application of economic regulation
across the globe
 and it's very important  to
highlight the competitive landscape
um airports compete  they compete
for traffic so they invest in air
service development
 hubs compete uamongst each other

so the european hubs are competing with
the
middle eastern hubs for for connecting
uh traffic
you have airports that compete in the
same catchment area
 you know with other modes of
transport or  even other
other  airports and that's on the
aeronautical side on the commercial side
of the business
you also have what airports are
competing
in terms of retail so they're competing
with amazon
alibaba  and when we talk about car
rental or car parking and these things
you know the ubers in the list so there
is competition there
, the other thing too is  if we look
at the dynamics of the airline industry
it  continues to consolidate so this
means that there is this rise of
dominant airlines
okay  so meaning there's significant
countervailing power by airlines and and
the market power of airports has
significantly reduced
so  meaning um it throws into question
the need for
economic regulation and price controls
really ultimately what we would want to
see
and we like i said earlier we
have a lot to learn from the from the
australians
 we need to think of these
light-handed approaches so
airports and airlines and as felipe
mentioned need to come together
and and and design consent you know
commercial agreements that  are kind
of market-based
and this will allow them to actually
share risks as opposed to having this
intrusive price regulation
so this is something  that needs to
be thought about as we go forward out of
the pandemic
\subsection{David interview}
thanks patrick and thanks .... i think it's
time for one last question and a brief
answer from both of you
before we wrap up  besides direct
investments and infrastructure
expansions
 and renewal of  infrastructure
uh to alleviate longer-term capacity
constraints um are there other solutions
that could complement this around
efficiencies etc
,Felipe a brief answer from neil and patrick
to finish off
\subsection{Felipe answer}
yeah i think uh going straight to the
point i think the the hygiene
and  sanitization of the airports is
a hot topic that you continue to be
in the future i think we realize that is
important
not only in the terms of pandemic but in
the in every time that we need to have a
clear
rules in terms of hygiene measures at
the airports as well
the second point is of course more
touch less technology at the airports
that you allow it to passengers to have
a seamless travel that's right basically
that is my
short list of of touch  the important
points that we believe that you need to
continue to invest
for the future 
\subsection{Patrick answer the same question as Felipe}
yeah and i mean
besides the kind of the brick and mortar
investments
 of course also making 
more efficient use of infrastructure
and here i mean there are many ways
that to think about this from an
operational perspective
 but we could also think about it from
from a slots
 perspective right so  we need to
find ways to
to ensure that the slots regime 
encourages
competition or allows for competition
when you have competition while you
 know extend
the these wider benefits to the
traveling public and ensures that
infrastructure is  used  more
efficiently
so this is something we also have to
think about going forward.
\subsection{Felipe has one thing to say, again}
yeah and just my  final talk,
we are an industry that 
is still basically regulated by 
a chicago convention that is from 1944
 they used to evolute a lot during
these times
and we have new challenges there that is
basically  the environmental challenge
the sustainability of the industry that
is key
for all of us that's why modernize
the regulatory framework of the industry
as patrick mentioned is a key element
for us to have our permit to grow in our
permit to continue to serve
the communities and consider to serve
the world   in 
the right manner that is the
the less polluted industry and of course
with the great connectivity to provide
business opportunities
and connectivity to the world as well
